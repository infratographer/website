## What is Infratographer?

[Architecture]: docs/architecture/architecture.md
[Roadmap]: docs/architecture/roadmap.md

## Why the name Infratographer?

The name Infratographer comes from the combination of "infrastructure" and "cartographer", as the system's mission is to be a source of truth and orchestration layer for all infrastructure. Infratographer provides a GraphQL API to access your infrastructure, allowing you to request specific information and navigate your infrastructure map. Think of it as a set of directions for your infrastructure, helping you to understand and manage the various interconnected components.
